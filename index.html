			<h1>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h1>
			<p>The Pomodoro Technique was developed in the late 1980s by then university student Francesco Cirillo. <br>
				 Cirillo was struggling to focus on his studies and complete assignments. Feeling overwhelmed, he asked himself to commit to just 10 minutes of focused study time. Encouraged by the challenge, he found a tomato (pomodoro in Italian) shaped kitchen timer, and the Pomodoro technique was born.</p>
			<p>Though Cirillo went on to write a <a href="https://francescocirillo.com/products/the-pomodoro-technique" target="_blank"> 130-page book</a> about the method,  its biggest strength is its simplicity:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Get a to-do list and a timer.
				</li>
				<li>
					Set your timer for 25 minutes, and focus on a single task until the timer rings.
				</li>
				<li>
					When your session ends, mark off one pomodoro and record what you completed.
				</li>
				<li>
					Then enjoy a five-minute break.
				</li>
				<li>
					After four pomodoros, take a longer, more restorative 15-30 minute break.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>What makes pomodoro so effective?</h2>
			<p>
				The arbitrary silliness of using a tomato as a stand-in for units of time belies the Pomodoro Technique's serious effectiveness when it comes to helping people get things done. Here's what makes the method uniquely suited to boosting productivity:
			</p>
			<h3>
				Making it easy to just get started
			</h3>
			<p>
				Research has shown the procrastination has little to do laziness or lack of self-control. Rather, we put things off avoid negative feelings. It's uncomfortable to stare down a big task or project - one you may not be sure how to even do or one involves a lot of uncertainty. So we turn to Twitter or Netflix instead to boost our mood, if only temporarily.
			</p>
			<h3>Combating distractions</h3>
			<p>
				If you have ever been interrupted when you were in a flow state, you know how difficult regaining focus can be. Yet, the constant stream of information pouring in via emails, team chats, and social media notifications demands more and more of our attention.
			</p>
			<p>
				While it would be nice to <a href="https://blog.doist.com/can-tech-companies-really-un-distract-us/?itm_campaign=pomodoro&itm_medium=referral&itm_source=productivity_methods_guides&_ga=2.205136656.1009760425.1643055683-1430240648.1643055682" target="_blank">blame technology</a> for everything, recent studies suggest over half of all workday distractions are self-inflicted — meaning we pull ourselves out of focus. In the moment, it can be easy to justify these internal pulls — <span>“This email is too important to wait,”</span> or <mark>“It took less than a minute to check my Twitter; it is not a real distraction.”</mark>
			</p>
			<h3>
				Becoming more aware of where your time goes
			</h3>
			<p id="about"> 
				When planning out our future projects, most of us fall victim to the planning fallacy — our tendency to vastly underestimate the time needed to complete future tasks, even when we know similar tasks have taken longer in the past. Your present self imagines your future self operating under entirely different circumstances and time restraints. <br> The Pomodoro technique can be a valuable weapon against the planning fallacy. When you start working in short, timed sessions, time is no longer an abstract concept but a concrete event. It becomes a pomodoro — a unit of both time and effort. <br> Distinct from the idea of 25 minutes of general "work," the pomodoro is an event that measures focus on a single task (or several simple tasks). <br> The concept of time changes from a negative — something that has been lost — to a positive representation of events accomplished. Cirillo calls this "inverting time" because it changes the perception of time passing from an abstract source of anxiety to an exact measure of productivity. This leads to much more realistic time estimates.
